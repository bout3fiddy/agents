```

## Workflow
1) Fetch the guidelines from the source URL above.
2) Read the target files (or ask the user for a file/pattern).
3) Check all rules from the fetched guidelines.
4) Output findings in the terse `file:line` format required by the guidelines.

If no files are specified, ask which files to review.
