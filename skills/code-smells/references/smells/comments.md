# Comments

Category: Dispensables

## Signals
- Comments explain confusing code instead of intent.
- Stale comments disagree with actual behavior.
- Commented-out code accumulates as dead history.

## Typical refactor directions
- Rename symbols and extract expressive methods.
- Remove dead/commented-out code.
- Keep comments for intent and constraints, not patching unclear code.
