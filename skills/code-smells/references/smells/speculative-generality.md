# Speculative Generality

Category: Dispensables

## Signals
- Abstractions exist for hypothetical future use only.
- Hooks and extension points are unused over time.
- Complexity is paid now for uncertain value later.

## Typical refactor directions
- Inline Class or Inline Method.
- Remove unused abstraction and simplify.
