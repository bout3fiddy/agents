# References Index

## References
- `references/ask-questions-if-underspecified.md` - Use when user requests implementation work (implement, add, create, build, refactor, fix) AND the request lacks clear acceptance criteria, scope, or constraints. Do NOT use during exploration, explanation, or continua...
- `references/linear-mcp-ops.md` - Manage Linear via MCP (create/update/search issues, tickets, tasks, projects, labels, comments, cycles). Auto-capture brainstorm/ideation into Linear, auto-check Linear context when conversation implies status/backlog...
- `references/spec-driven-iterative-builder.md` - Spec-first, iterative delivery workflow. Use when asked to tackle future considerations, do research/architecture, try approaches, keep progress in docs/specs, or continue building without frequent check-ins.
