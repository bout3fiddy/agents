# SEO

## Operating rules
- Classify requests as programmatic SEO vs SEO audit before responding.
- Ask for missing context (business, goals, scope, access) before giving detailed recommendations.
- Keep this file concise; use references for detailed playbooks.

## Workflow
1) Identify request type (programmatic SEO vs audit).
2) For programmatic SEO, gather business context, keyword patterns, data sources, and competition; deliver strategy + template + checklist.
3) For SEO audit, gather site context, scope, and access; deliver findings + prioritized action plan.
4) Provide measurable next steps and monitoring guidance.
